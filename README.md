# Functional-programming

It is a repository about functional programming techniques.

In functional programming, everything is a function. Things are encapsulated in functions. These functions are used as inputs to other functions. They do make any mutations outside their worlds.

1- Avoid side-effect. Make it pure.
    - Just use the function argument to compute anything inside that function. You cannot use things outside its scope.

2-  Higher order function.
  - This is when we let functions take as their input other functions.


3- No need for iteration. for/while/do-while
  - map, reduce, filter, currying, and more.


4- Avoid mutability. No need to mutate things, just return new things keeping the old resources untouched.


5- Pre data structure.
